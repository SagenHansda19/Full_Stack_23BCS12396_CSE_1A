## System Architecture

The application follows a standard client-server architecture:

1.  The **React frontend** acts as the client, providing a dynamic user interface.
2.  It communicates with the backend via a **RESTful API**.
3.  The **Spring Boot backend** handles all business logic, data processing, and authentication.
4.  A **PostgreSQL** database persists all application data.
